The rising incidence of chronic diseases and the need for innovative therapies are two major factors fueling this growth. In 2024, the global market size for model organism rodents is projected to reach approximately <strong>$4.5 billion</strong>. By 2032, this figure is expected to grow to around <strong>$7.8 billion</strong>, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately <strong>7.8%</strong>.</p><p>The surge in biotechnology research is further bolstered by advancements in genetic engineering and personalized medicine. Researchers are increasingly relying on transgenic and knockout rodent models to understand disease mechanisms and validate drug efficacy. This reliance is anticipated to propel the market, with a significant shift towards using genetically modified rodents in research settings. The growing emphasis on drug discovery and development, particularly in areas like oncology, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune disorders, also plays a pivotal role in market expansion.</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Model Organism Rodent Market Report @</span>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/415022/?utm_source=Pulse-2&amp;utm_medium=332">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/415022/?utm_source=Pulse-2&amp;utm_medium=332</a></p><p>Moreover, the rising trend of outsourcing research activities to contract research organizations (CROs) is contributing to market growth. Many pharmaceuticals and biotech companies are choosing to collaborate with CROs for their specialized expertise and efficiency in handling rodent models, thereby reducing their internal costs. Such collaborations are expected to continue driving growth in the model organism rodent market.</p><p>From 2024 to 2032, the demand for rodents in toxicology and safety testing is also expected to increase, as regulatory bodies emphasize the importance of preclinical studies. The model organism rodent market will likely witness substantial investments in research and development, improving facilities and technologies utilized in the care and breeding of these organisms. Additionally, the ongoing focus on ethical research practices may lead to advancements in humane treatment protocols, further enhancing market dynamics.</p></span></p><p><strong><span class="">What are the&nbsp;Type driving the growth of the Model Organism Rodent Market?</span></strong></p></div><div class="" data-test-id=""><p><span class="">Growing demand for below Type around the world has had a direct impact on the growth of the Model Organism Rodent Market:</span></p></div><div class="" data-test-id=""><p>Rat, Mouse</p><p><span class=""><strong>What are the&nbsp;Applications&nbsp;of Model Organism Rodent Market available in the Market?</strong></span></p></div><div class="" data-test-id=""><p><span class="">Based on Application the Market is categorized into Below types that held the largest Model Organism Rodent Market share In 2024.</span></p></div><div class="" data-test-id=""><p><span class="">Drug Discovery, Basic Research, Toxicity Test, Parasitological Study, Hereditary Disease Study</span></p><p><span class=""><strong>Who is the largest Manufacturers of Model Organism Rodent Market worldwide?</strong></span></p></div><div class="" data-test-id=""><p><span class="">Shanghai Model Organisms Center, Inc., Gem Pharmatech Co., Ltd., Charles River Laboratories, Envigo, Taconic Biosciences, Jackson Laboratory, Shanghai SLAC, Joinn Laboratories, Crown Biosciences, Pharmalegacy, Syngene International, Janvier Labs, GenOway, Psychogenics, Horizon Discovery Group, Vitalstar Biotechnology</span></p></div><div class="" data-test-id="">&nbsp;</div><div class="" data-test-id="">&nbsp;</div><div class="" data-test-id=""><p><span class=""><strong>Get Discount On The Purchase Of This Report @</strong> <a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/ask-for-discount/415022&utm_source=Github&utm_medium=332" target="_blank">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/ask-for-discount/415022&utm_source=Github&utm_medium=332</a></span></p></div><div class="" data-test-id=""><div class="article-main__content" data-test-id="publishing-text-block"><h3><span class="">Global Model Organism Rodent Market Regional Analysis</span></h3></div><div class="article-main__content" data-test-id="publishing-text-block"><p><span class="">To conduct a regional analysis of the global Model Organism Rodent Market, we typically examine various regions such as North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East &amp; Africa.
